// ============================================================
// ELEMENTS — the law. One entry per element the theme must address:
// its family, the axes a designer needs on it (with the allowed values), and why.
// ============================================================
//
// Everything derives from this table, downward only:
//   theme types     what a theme may author for the element   (cascade.ts → ElementTypes)
//   engine          the selector and the family extras         (conventions.ts → ELEMENT_FAMILIES)
//   components      the axis props the component may carry     (ElementProps<key>)
//   dictionary      the list people read
//
// Reasoning applied:
//   parent    emphasis, scale, and what happens to it as a whole (loading, disabled)
//   child     its own states; status where it can carry a condition
//   outer     a control that has a moving or appearing inner: the ring, the track, the box
//   inner     the dot, the thumb, the check, the fill: a surface of its own, follows the outer,
//             `selected` is where it appears or moves to (translate under selected)
//   part      separators, structure: nothing
//   standalone everything
//   not here  a nav or a top bar: compositions a slice builds from these rows inside a layout region
// Status goes to fields, controls, and containers that highlight a child in error.
// `platform` says where the element exists: both, the web only, or mobile only. On mobile an element takes its
// states minus `hover`; where it has `hover`, mobile has `long-pressed` in its place; `mobileState` adds the rest.
// `none` means the axis does not apply. `concept` is on every element and never listed.
// `position` (types/axes.ts POSITION) says where the element stands in its parent and how much it takes: a markup axis,
// one value = one fixed set of structural classes (web/components/src/lib/position.ts); the theme never reads it.
